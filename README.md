A collection of Projects to showcase my coding skills

<h1>00 Heads or Tails </h1>
<p> My first university assignment using JavaScript. I was tasked with creating the code to play a game of Heads or Tails.<br>

The minimum requirements were to promt the user for a Heads or Tails decision, then based on that to check the choice against a random toss of a coin. The result would be counted and tallied against the answer along with how many times the user was correct. <br>

The restrictions were that I was not allowed to modify the html or css file directly.

I was able to do the basic task fairly quickly thus I challenged myself with making it more user friendly while still following the restrictions of the assignment. I researched and applied knowledge i found to modify the html only when the JavaScript code is executed. This allowed me to add buttoms to the task and prompt the user for a choice after each toss of the coin. All the while scoring the answers appropriately. This also allowed me to remove any input error from the user as it was a click button. </p>
